## Project List

### Easy Mode

#### 1. File Organizer (DONE)
- **Objective:** Create a Python script that automatically organizes files in a directory based on their type (e.g., images, documents, videos, etc.).
- **Skills Practiced:**
  - File system operations (moving, renaming, and deleting files).
  - Working with directories and files in Linux.
  - Using Python's `os` and `shutil` libraries.
- **How to do it:**
  - Use Python to read the files in a directory and sort them by file extension.
  - Create folders for each file type and move the files into the corresponding folder.

#### 2. Basic To-Do List Application (DONE)
- **Objective:** Develop a simple terminal-based to-do list application using Python that stores tasks in a text file.
- **Skills Practiced:**
  - Basic Python file handling (reading/writing to a file).
  - Working with terminal input/output.
- **How to do it:**
  - Write functions to add, remove, and view tasks in a to-do list.
  - Store the list of tasks in a text file so it persists after the program ends.

#### 3. Weather Data Fetcher (DONE)
- **Objective:** Create a Python script that fetches weather information for a specified location using a public API like OpenWeatherMap.
- **Skills Practiced:**
  - Making HTTP requests with `requests` library.
  - Handling APIs and JSON data.
- **How to do it:**
  - Use Python to send a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API.
  - Parse the JSON response to extract weather data.

#### 4. System Resource Monitor (DONE)
- **Objective:** Build a simple Python script to monitor system resources (CPU, memory, disk usage) in Ubuntu and display them in the terminal.
- **Skills Practiced:**
  - Using Python’s `psutil` library to gather system data.
- **How to do it:**
  - Install the `psutil` library.
  - Write a script that monitors system stats like CPU usage, RAM, disk space.

#### 5. Simple Chatbot in Terminal
- **Objective:** Build a simple command-line chatbot in Python that can respond to basic queries from the user.
- **Skills Practiced:**
  - Working with Python’s string manipulation and conditionals.
- **How to do it:**
  - Define a set of responses to specific inputs.
  - Use a loop to continually ask the user for input and respond.

#### 6. Backup Script
- **Objective:** Write a Python script that creates backups of important directories or files on your system and stores them in a designated backup folder.
- **Skills Practiced:**
  - File handling and copying in Python.
- **How to do it:**
  - Write a script that copies files from a source directory to a backup directory.
  - Add timestamps to the backup folder names.

#### 7. Linux Process Killer
- **Objective:** Create a Python script that monitors running processes on Ubuntu and kills specific processes by their name or PID.
- **Skills Practiced:**
  - Using Python's `os` and `psutil` libraries.
- **How to do it:**
  - Use `psutil` to list all running processes and their details.
  - Filter the list for specific processes and kill them.

#### 8. Simple Log File Analyzer
- **Objective:** Write a Python script that reads log files and analyzes specific events or errors.
- **Skills Practiced:**
  - File reading and processing in Python.
- **How to do it:**
  - Open a log file in Python and read it line by line.
  - Search for specific log entries and output relevant information.

#### 9. Website Status Checker
- **Objective:** Build a Python script that checks if a website is up or down by sending HTTP requests.
- **Skills Practiced:**
  - Making requests using the `requests` library.
- **How to do it:**
  - Use Python's `requests` library to check the status of a website.
  - Print the HTTP status code and a message if the site is up or down.

#### 10. Automated File Downloader
- **Objective:** Write a Python script that automatically downloads files from a given URL.
- **Skills Practiced:**
  - Using `requests` or `urllib` to download files.
- **How to do it:**
  - Use `requests` to download files from a URL.
  - Store the downloaded file in a specific directory.
